                    in Newark, NJ.
                    <br>Some history and pictures of the buildings will be included as well.</p>

                 <h3>Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart</h3>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Sacred_Heart_fr_hill_center_jeh.jpg/800px-Sacred_Heart_fr_hill_center_jeh.jpg">
                <p class="lead">Starting with my favorite building in Newark, this cathedral basilica
                    is a giant 260 feet tall church that was proposed in 1859 by James Roosevelt
                    Bayley, the bishop of Newark.
                    <br>The original design was inspired by an English-Irish Gothic Revival church,
                    but later was modified to take the characteristics of a French Gothic Revival
                    church.</p>

                 <h3>Krueger-Scott Mansion</h3>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/High_Court_Sts_castle_jeh.jpg/1024px-High_Court_Sts_castle_jeh.jpg">
                <p class="lead">A building that I'm sure you have seen many times is the Krueger-Scott
                    Mansion on MLK Boulevard which was also known as High Street at the time
                    of construction in 1888.
                    <br>The mansion holds 40 rooms supplemented by a 700-seat auditorium and although
                    built by Gottfried Krueger in 1888, was sold to Louise Scott for $85,000
                    in 1958.
                    <br>On the first floor of the mansion, Scott held her beauty school classes
                    in the lobby area while keeping anything above her own private residence.
                    You could say she was living luxuriously!</p>

                 <h3>Essex County Courthouse</h3>
                <img src="https://www.cassgilbertsociety.org/images/works/m/essex-county-courthouse.jpg">
                <p class="lead">The Essex County Courthouse is located right next to all three campuses
                    of University Heights. Built in 1904, this gigantic monument to justice
                    was erected by Cass Gilbert
                    <br>The building features artwork from some of the most well known artists
                    of the American Renaissance period. One such piece of work sits right in
                    front of the courthouse.
                    <br>The 100% bronze statue created by Gutzon Borglum dedicated by Ted Roosevelt
                    himself on Memorial Day 1911.</p>
