                 <h3>About The Project</h3>
                <p class="lead">When I was thinking about the final project for this class, I was wondering
                    where I would begin to utilize what I've learned from this school and my
                    passions to create a project that I thought would reflect both nicely.
                    I love making websites since it is a part of coding that doesn't require
                    hours of math or studying to learn. It is simply a skill that anyone can
                    pick up and be very creative with.
                    <br>
                    <br>When picking the subject, I knew from the start that I was going to do
                    something on the history and architecture of the buildings of Newark. Being
                    a student of NJIT and a resident of Newark, The buildings were always my
                    favorite part whenever I would drive in and out of Newark on errand runs
                    or just going back home to my family. I will also attribute it to the fact
                    that a lot of my close friends that I have made here at NJIT are architecture
                    students who I will be sadly leaving while they finish their fifth and
                    final year next year. I figured the best I could do is pay tribute to them
                    in a fun way.
                    <br>
                    <br>That leads me to right now where I am coding this entire project in HTML
                    and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript to run the fluidity of the site.
                    The site host I will be using for this project is GitHub instead of NJIT's
                    AFS server since I have had issues with implementing all the things that
                    I want plus I have some gripes against the public_html system NJIT uses.
                    <br>
                    <br>That being said, I hope you enjoy this little website that I put together!</p>

                 <h3>Concerning Oral Presentation</h3>
                <p class="lead">For the Oral Presentation, I was going to go more into detail on the buildings
                    that I have chosen to show. What I found interesting was the idea of the
                    history behind the buildings since that would give more of an inside look
                    into Newark from before the 1960s. I think if people were to understand
                    the rich culture and history beforehand, more people would appreciate Newark
                    for what it is: a historical monument that has seen many phases, but is
                    still standing.
                    <br>
                    <br>From there, my oral presentation would dive into the importance of history
                    as well as how much history a building could hold. That idea alone could
                    be used to reach the sentimental values of those listening, and hopefully
                    encourage them to treat Newark as their temporary home and decide against
                    apathetic acts like littering and such.</p>
