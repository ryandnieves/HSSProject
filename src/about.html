    <h3>About The Project</h3>
    <p>When I was thinking about the final project for this class, I was wondering where I would begin to utilize what I've learned from this school and my passions to create
    a project that I thought would reflect both nicely. I love making websites since it is a part of coding that doesn't require hours of math or studying to learn. It is simply a skill that anyone can pick up and be very creative with.
      <br>
    <br>When picking the subject, I knew from the start that I was going to do something on the history and architecture of the buildings of Newark. Being a student of NJIT and a resident of Newark,
    The buildings were always my favorite part whenever I would drive in and out of Newark on errand runs or just going back home to my family. I will also attribute it to the fact that a lot of my close friends that I have made
    here at NJIT are architecture students who I will be sadly leaving while they finish their fifth and final year next year. I figured the best I could do is pay tribute to them in a fun way.
    <br>
      <br>
      That leads me to right now where I am coding this entire project in HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript to run the fluidity of the site. The site host I will be using for this project is GitHub
      instead of NJIT's AFS server since I have had issues with implementing all the things that I want plus I have some gripes against the public_html system NJIT uses.
    <br>
      <br>That being said, I hope you enjoy this little website that I put together!
