    <p class="lead">Starting with my favorite building in Newark, this cathedral basilica is a giant 260 feet tall church that was proposed in 1859 by James Roosevelt Bayley, the bishop of Newark.
    <br>The original design was inspired by an English-Irish Gothic Revival church, but later was modified to take the characteristics of a French Gothic Revival church. </p>

    <p class="lead">A building that I'm sure you have seen many times is the Krueger-Scott Mansion on MLK Boulevard which was also known as High Street at the time of construction in 1888.
    <br>The mansion holds 40 rooms supplemented by a 700-seat auditorium and although built by Gottfried Krueger in 1888, was sold to Louise Scott for $85,000 in 1958.
    <br>On the first floor of the mansion, Scott held her beauty school classes in the lobby area while keeping anything above her own private residence. You could say she was living luxuriously!</p>

    <p class="lead">The Essex County Courthouse is located right next to all three campuses of University Heights. Built in 1904, this gigantic monument to justice was erected by Cass Gilbert
    <br>The building features artwork from some of the most well known artists of the American Renaissance period. One such piece of work sits right in front of the courthouse.

    <h3>John Ballantine House</h3>
    <img src="https://anothertownonthehudson.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ballantine-house-1.jpg">
    <p class="lead">The John Ballantine House faces Washington Park on Washington Street where the three-story masonry structure stands proudly. It is built out of an original
      Philadelphia pressed brick topped with a truncated hip roof. The entrance is supported by giant stone portico with rounded arches that are supported by 100% pure granite columns.
      <br>Built in 1884, the design can be attributed to George Edward Harney to serve as the home of Jeannette Boyed and John Holme Ballantine. The ladder of which was the son of
      Peter Ballantine, the founder of Ballantine Brewery. The house has since been designated as a national landmark and therefore has been maintained well to be used as a museum.
